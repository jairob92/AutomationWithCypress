# Automation Project with Cypress and Cucumber ðŸš€

This repository contains a basic test automation project using Cypress and Cucumber. The chosen design approach is the Page Object Model (POM), enhancing code organization and maintenance. Additionally, the project utilizes the Gherkin language for scenario specification.

## Integration with Cucumber and Babel Preprocessor ðŸ¥’

The repository is integrated with the Babel preprocessor for Cucumber, enabling the use of Babelball contributor guidelines in test specification.

## Integrated with:

- [x] https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
- [x] https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor

## Clone the Repository

To clone this repository and start working on the project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the repository

## Prerequisites
Before working with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Node.js: Download and install Node.js
2. Install project dependencies with: npm i

## Running Tests
You can execute the tests in two ways: through the command line or by visualizing the results in the Cypress user interface.

To run the tests through the command line, use the following command:

#### Cypress Command Line
To run the tests through the command line, use the following command:
```
npx cypress run
```

#### Cypress User Interface
If you prefer to view the results in the Cypress user interface, run the following command:

```
npx cypress run
```

## Conclusions
In this project, we've explored test automation using Cypress and Cucumber, two powerful tools that provide a structured and efficient testing approach. The combination of Cypress and Cucumber enables the creation of test scenarios in natural language, fostering collaboration between technical and non-technical teams.

Adopting the Page Object Model (POM) provides an organized architecture that improves the maintainability and scalability of automation code. Furthermore, integration with the Babel preprocessor and Babelball contributor guidelines establishes a robust framework for test specification.

It's essential to note that this project serves as a simple example of what can be achieved with web application test automation. Cypress and Cucumber offer the flexibility needed to address more complex test cases and real-world application scenarios. The ability to execute tests quickly and reliably, coupled with clarity in expressing test cases, makes these tools valuable in the development and quality assurance process.
